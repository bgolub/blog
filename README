How to Deploy:

1) Get a Google App Engine account at http://appengine.google.com
2) Create a new application.  Note your application identifier.
3) Edit the include app.yaml.sample:
    i) Change the text APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER to the application identifier
    created in step 2.
    ii) Rename it to app.yaml
4) Edit the included settings.py.sample:
    i) Variables are self explanatory.
    ii) Rename it to settings.py
5) Edit base.html to make it your own:
    i) There are several instances of "Benjamin Golub", links to my FriendFeed,
    and my email address peppered in the templates.  Until I move all of that
    out into the settings you'll have to edit them by hand, sorry!
    ii) Make sure to point Disqus to your account and not mine!
6) Deploy!
    i) Via command line:
        Move to the directory containing app.yaml and do "appcfg.py update ."
    ii) Via GoogleAppEngineLauncher (for Mac):
        Drag the directory onto the window, click on the app, hit deploy!
7) Start blogging by visiting http://your_blog_url/new
    i) That will prompt you for your Google Account.  Login with the same one
    you use to login to http://appengine.google.com.  Only that account can
    add/edit/delete posts.
7) Let me know that you're using it :)  bgolub@benjamingolub.com
